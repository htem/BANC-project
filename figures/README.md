# BANC Paper Figures

This directory contains all publication figures from the BANC paper. Each figure can be reproduced using the corresponding R scripts in the `R/figures/` directory.

## Figure Organisation

Each figure has its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
figure_X/
â”œâ”€â”€ figure.ai          # Adobe Illustrator source file
â”œâ”€â”€ figure.png         # High-resolution figure image  
â”œâ”€â”€ supplement-1.ai    # Supplemental figure source (if applicable)
â”œâ”€â”€ supplement-1.png   # Supplemental figure image (if applicable)
â””â”€â”€ links/             # Individual figure panels and components
    â”œâ”€â”€ panel_A.png    # Figure component A
    â”œâ”€â”€ panel_B.pdf    # Figure component B  
    â””â”€â”€ ...           # Additional panels and data visualizations
```

## Figure List

### [Figure 1: An open-source brain-and-nerve-cord connectome](figure_1/)

### [Figure 4: Specializations and coordination within a functional supercluster](figure_4/)
Detailed analysis of head and eye orienting circuits showing specialized and coordinated neural control.

**Generated by:** `R/figures/panels_body_parts.R`

### [Figure 5: Interactions between behaviour-centric modules](figure_5/)
Network analysis of interactions between different behavioural modules and their coordination patterns.

**Generated by:** `R/figures/panel_sensory_motor.R`

### [Figure 6: Linking CNS networks with superclusters of ANs and DNs](figure_6/)
Integration of central brain networks (mushroom body, central complex) with behaviour-centric AN-DN modules.

## Reproducing Figures

1. **Setup Data Access:** Configure data paths in `R/startup/banc-startup.R`
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure required R packages are installed (see main README)
3. **Run Figure Scripts:** Execute the appropriate script from `R/figures/` to generate panels
4. **Access Panels:** Find generated panels in the `links/` subdirectory
5. **View Final Figures:** The composed figures are available as `.png` files

## File Formats

- **`.ai`** - Adobe Illustrator source files (editable vector format)
- **`.png`** - High-resolution raster images (recommended for viewing)
- **`.pdf`** - Vector format panels (used for final figure composition)
- **Links Directory** - Contains individual panels that compose each figure

## Color Schemes

All figures use standardised colour palettes defined in `settings/paper_colours_lacroix.csv` to ensure consistency across visualisations.
