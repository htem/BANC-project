## Overview

This repository contains code and data for the first unified connectome of a limbed animal's brain and nerve cord. The BANC dataset includes ~160,000 neurons from an adult female *Drosophila melanogaster*, representing the complete central nervous system from brain to ventral nerve cord.

üè¶ **Ready to take your research to the BANC?** This connectome offers unprecedented insights into distributed neural control...

üß† **Don't just bank on assumptions about neural circuits** - explore the actual wiring with BANC's comprehensive connectivity data...

**Key Discoveries:**
- First unified brain-and-nerve-cord connectome revealing distributed control architecture
- Discovery of behaviour-centric neural modules organised by ascending/descending pathways  
- Local feedback loops that challenge traditional hierarchical models of motor control
- Novel influence metrics quantifying indirect neural pathway effects
- Integration with existing connectomes (FlyWire-FAFB brain, MANC nerve cord)

**Collaborative Effort:** This work represents a massive research community open-science effort with 155+ contributors from 35+ institutions worldwide, combining electron microscopy, AI-assisted segmentation, and community-based proofreading and annotation.

**Dataset Version:** This repository corresponds to BANC v626, the version used in the preprint. We plan to release an updated version in the coming months with improved reconstruction, enhanced annotations, and completed optic lobe coverage.

üí° **For the most up-to-date connectome information and latest annotations, visit [FlyWire Codex](https://codex.flywire.ai/banc) - your go-to source for current BANC data. FlyWire Codex was built and maintained by [Arie Marisliah](https://arie.matsliah.org/)**

### Authenticated Data Access

**For users who want to edit the data and add their own annotations.**

To access BANC resources, you must have permissions to access the [BANC autosegmentation dataset](https://fanc-reconstruction.slack.com/archives/C01RZP5JH9C/p1616522511001900) and have [confirmed your acceptance](https://fanc-reconstruction.slack.com/archives/C01RZP5JH9C/p1617404290005300) of the BANC proofreading and data ownership guidelines. At this point you should have a linked Google account that will be authorised for access to BANC online resources.

If you have access, you can view *BANC* data in this helpful [neuroglancer scene](https://spelunker.cave-explorer.org/#!middleauth+https://global.daf-apis.com/nglstate/api/v1/4753860997414912).

The BANC project uses [CAVE tables](https://global.daf-apis.com/info/) to store many sorts of annotation information. You can see the available CAVE tables for BANC [here](https://cave.fanc-fly.com/annotation/views/aligned_volume/brain_and_nerve_cord). CAVE tables can be joined into useful [CAVE views](https://cave.fanc-fly.com/materialize/views/datastack/brain_and_nerve_cord) pinned to a materialisation, which can provide very useful objects such as the whole BANC edgelist. BANC view names and SQL formulas are given [here](https://github.com/jasper-tms/the-BANC-fly-connectome/wiki/CAVE-Views).

## Database Schema Reference

</div>

An SQLite file is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained relational database engine that stores the entire database as a single file on disk. We are using them to compile connectome data for convenience. The major advantages are:

Serverless: Unlike MySQL or PostgreSQL, it doesn't require a separate server process
Portable: The entire database is contained in a single file that can be easily shared or moved
Lightweight: Low overhead, quick to set up, and requires minimal configuration
Zero-configuration: No complex setup needed
Cross-platform: Works identically across different operating systems

Here is what our connectome files contain:

edgelist_simple - each row is a unique neuron-neuron connection
========================================================================================

**pre**     :   the neuron ID for the source (i.e. upstream, presynaptic) neuron. For FAFB this is a root_id for BANC, root_783 for FAFB, cell_id for FANC and bodyid for MANC and Hemibrain.

**post**    :   the neuron ID for the target (i.e. downstream, pesynaptic) neuron. For FAFB this is a root_id for BANC, root_783 for FAFB, cell_id for FANC and bodyid for MANC and Hemibrain.

**count**   :   the number of synaptic links that connect pre to post. For FAFB a cleft_score threshold of 50 has been applied.

**norm**    :   the normalised weight of a connection, this is count/post_count, where post_count are the total number of inputs to the target neuron (post).

**pre_count**  :   the total number of oututs from the target neuron (post) NOT the source neuron (pre). *I understand this is a little confusing, and will seek to change the column names to use pre/post for synapses and sourcd/target for neurons in the future.*

**post_count** :   the total number of inputs to the target neuron (post).


*other coumns with information from 'meta' may exist for convenience, with pre/post appended to the name to idicate labelled neuron*

========================================================================================
***NOTE*** *each 'compartment' on each row is an axon/dendrite/primary neurite/primary dendrite/unknown cable for a neuron*

**post**    :   the neuron ID for the target (i.e. downstrea, pesynaptic) neuron. For FAFB this is a root_id for BANC, root_783 for FAFB, cell_id for FANC and bodyid for MANC and Hemibrain.

**pre_count**  :   the total number of oututs from the target neuron (post) NOT the source neuron (pre). *I understand this is a little confusing, and will seek to change the column names to use pre/post for synapses and sourcd/target for neurons in the future.*

**pre_label_count**  :   the total number of oututs from the specified target neuron compartment (post+post_label) NOT the specified target neuron compartment (post+post_label). *I understand this is a little confusing, and will seek to change the column names to use pre/post for synapses and sourcd/target for neurons in the future.*

**post_label_count** :   the total number of inputs to the specified target neuron compartment (post+post_label).

**count**   :   the number of synaptic links that connect pre+pre_label to post+post_label. For FAFB a cleft_score threshold of 50 has been applied.

## Influence

We have also calculated and compiled indirect 'influence' scores, using a linear dynamical model. See code and method [here](https://github.com/DrugowitschLab/ConnectomeInfluenceCalculator). These seed groups are explained [here](https://github.com/jasper-tms/BANC-project/blob/main/notes/seeds.md). Among the most useful are seed groups are seed_01 (run from afferents of different sensory modalities, at a coarse grain) and seed_03 (run from different sensory modalities, broken down by body part of origin as well as modality/sub-modality).
