  abstract  = "Body movement often evokes strong changes in neural activity in
               visual brain regions. Some of this movement-related activity is
               locked to locomotion, while other activity is locked to the
               movements of particular body parts. Visual brain regions are
               thought to use information about body movements to suppress or
               emphasize specific visual stimuli that might be expected to
               accompany these movements. However, we do not fully understand
               how these movement-related signals arise. Here, we show that a
               cell type in the Drosophila visual system (LT52) is strongly
               activated when flies groom their heads. Notably, LT52 neurons are
               active during grooming, even in blind flies, indicating that
               these signals are partly non-visual in origin. The non-visual
               component of LT52 activity is correlated with the movement of the
               ipsilateral foreleg, indicating that it likely arises from
               foreleg proprioceptors or motor commands. Grooming responses in
               LT52 neurons are also partly visual in origin. This visual
               component is recruited by large, moving objects with vertically
               extended edges-visual stimuli that resemble the fly's leg as it
               sweeps across the eye during grooming. The connectome shows that
               LT52 is anatomically positioned to inhibit the neural networks
               involved in steering toward a visual object in the environment.
               Thus, we suggest that LT52 functions to prevent the fly from
               steering toward its own leg. Together, our results show how
               neurons in visual brain regions can acquire selectivity for
               specific movements or gestures, using a combination of visual
               reafference and internal self-motion signals.",

              aversion. Connectomics data place these neurons in a complete

              regulates R axon lamination and how lamination affects R neuron

              innervated by small-field and large-field neurons and that early
              developing EB neurons play an important regulatory role in EB
              laminae formation. The transmembrane proteins semaphorin-1a
              (Sema-1a) and plexin A function together to regulate R axon
              lamination. R neurons recruit both GABA and GABA-A receptors to
              their axon terminals in the EB, and optogenetic stimulation
              coupled with electrophysiological recordings show that
              Sema-1a-dependent R axon lamination is required for preventing the
              spread of synaptic inhibition between adjacent EB lamina. These
              results provide direct evidence that EB lamination is critical for
              local pre-synaptic inhibitory circuit organization.",

               rather is a modifier of stress-induced behavior. dARC1 is
               expressed in a number of neurosecretory cells and mutants are
               starvation-resistant, exhibiting an increased time of survival in

              mechanistic understanding of the basis of such variation. Here, we
              investigated whether Drosophila melanogaster displays
              individual-to-individual variation in locomotor behaviors. We
              developed a new high-throughout platform capable of measuring the
              exploratory behavior of hundreds of individual flies
              simultaneously. With this approach, we find that, during

              their left vs. right locomotor choices, with some flies being
              strongly left biased or right biased. This idiosyncrasy was
              present in all genotypes examined, including wild-derived
              populations and inbred isogenic laboratory strains. The biases of
              individual flies persist for their lifetime and are nonheritable:
              i.e., mating two left-biased individuals does not yield

              with other asymmetries, such as the handedness of gut twisting,
              leg-length asymmetry, and wing-folding preference. Using
              transgenics and mutants, we find that the magnitude of locomotor
              handedness is under the control of columnar neurons within the
              central complex, a brain region implicated in motor planning and
              execution. When these neurons are silenced, exploratory laterality
              increases, with more extreme leftiness and rightiness. This

  abstract = "Summary Insects, like most animals, tend to steer away from
              imminent threats [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Drosophila melanogaster,
              for example, generally initiate an escape take-off in response to
              a looming visual stimulus, mimicking a potential predator [8]. The
              escape response to a visual threat is, however, flexible [9, 10,
              11, 12] and can alternatively consist of walking backward away
              from the perceived threat [11], which may be a more effective
              response to ambush predators such as nymphal praying mantids [7].
              Flexibility in escape behavior may also add an element of
              unpredictability that makes it difficult for predators to
              anticipate or learn the prey’s likely response [3, 4, 5, 6].
              Whereas the fly’s escape jump has been well studied [8, 9, 13, 14,
              15, 16, 17, 18], the neuronal underpinnings of evasive walking
              remain largely unexplored. We previously reported the
              identification of a cluster of descending neurons—the moonwalker
              descending neurons (MDNs)—the activity of which is necessary and
              sufficient to trigger backward walking [19], as well as a
              population of visual projection neurons—the lobula columnar 16
              (LC16) cells—that respond to looming visual stimuli and elicit
              backward walking and turning [11]. Given the similarity of their
              activation phenotypes, we hypothesized that LC16 neurons induce
              backward walking via MDNs and that turning while walking backward
              might reflect asymmetric activation of the left and right MDNs.
              Here, we present data from functional imaging, behavioral
              epistasis, and unilateral activation experiments that support
              these hypotheses. We conclude that LC16 and MDNs are critical
              components of the neural circuit that transduces threatening
              visual stimuli into directional locomotor output.",

              multiple control circuits. Here, however, we present evidence for
              a central steering circuit in Drosophila that is used for both
              goal-directed and exploratory turns and is capable of eliciting
              turns ranging from subtle course corrections to rapid saccades.
              The circuit is organized in a hierarchy, the top layer of which
              comprises the reciprocally connected DNa03 and LAL013 neurons. Our
              data suggest that turns are initiated by DNa03 neurons and
              reinforced and stabilized through a winner-take-all mechanism
              involving LAL013. The descending DNa11 neurons form an
              intermediate layer. They receive input from both DNa03 and LAL013
              and target leg motor circuits directly as well as indirectly
              through subordinate descending neurons. DNa11 activation
              coordinately changes the stepping directions of all six legs to
              generate rapid saccadic turns. Together, these data define a
              central steering control circuit in Drosophila that is flexibly
              used to generate turns as the fly exploits or explores its
              environment. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have

              investigate a class of proprioceptors on the Drosophila leg called
              hair plates. Using calcium imaging in behaving flies, we find that
              a hair plate on the fly coxa (CxHP8) detects the limits of
              anterior leg movement. Reconstructing CxHP8 axons in the
              connectome, we found that they are wired to excite posterior leg
              movement and inhibit anterior leg movement. Consistent with this
              connectivity, optogenetic activation of CxHP8 neurons elicited
              posterior postural reflexes, while silencing altered the

               circuits involved in posture and locomotion. In conclusion, we
               will present a few issues that have, until today, been little

               selected to engage a specific motor behavior and how feedback
               from thoracic circuitry modulate the head ganglia circuitries.

               locusts, crickets, and stick insects but will mostly focus on
               cockroaches and the fruit fly, Drosophila.",

               studies of these peptides in insects were limited to
               orthopterans, this investigation focuses on dipteran flies.
               Extracts of heads from the blowfly Phormia terraenovae were
               assessed in a fiddler crab bioassay for PDH activity.
               Immunocytochemistry, dose-response curves, gel filtration
               chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, combined with bioassay
               and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indicate the
               presence of PDH-like peptide in the blowfly. Immunocytochemical
               mapping of PDH-like immunoreactive (PDHLI) neurons was performed
               for the entire nervous systems of Phormia and the fruitfly
               Drosophila with a beta-PDH antiserum. In the cephalic ganglion
               (brain, optic lobe and subesophageal ganglion) PDHLI cell bodies
               could be detected (34 in Phormia and 16 in Drosophila). In both
               species, each hemisphere contains 8 PDHLI cell bodies in the
               optic lobes. These innervate the optic lobe neuropils
               bilaterally. In Phormia, another set of 8 cell bodies are located
               in each of the lateral neurosecretory cell groups in the superior
               protocerebrum. These neurons send axons to the corpora
               cardiaca-hypocerebral ganglion complex and to portions of the
               foregut. In contrast, only the optic lobe neurons display
               immunoreactivity in Drosophila. Except for the optic lobes, PDHLI
               processes are distributed only in nonglomerular neurophils of the
               brain of both species. In the fused thoracico-abdominal ganglia
               of Phormia, 28 PDHLI cell bodies were found (only six were found
               in Drosophila). In both species, six abdominal PDHLI neurons are
               efferents with axons innervating the hindgut. We also found that
               some of the PDHLI neurons in the Phormia brain and abdominal
               ganglion contain colocalized FMRFamide-like immunoreactivity.
               Since the flies studied here do not display hormonally
               controlled, fast pigment migrations, the PDH-like peptide may
               have a role as neurotransmitter or neuromodulator in the central
               nervous system, especially in the visual system, and a regulatory

               metrics of those actions. It is commonly suggested that the brain
               addresses these by first constructing representations of the
               world on which to build knowledge and make a decision, and then
               by computing and executing an action plan. However,
               neurophysiological data argue against this serial viewpoint. In
               contrast, it is proposed here that the brain processes sensory
               information to specify, in parallel, several potential actions
               that are currently available. These potential actions compete
               against each other for further processing, while information is
               collected to bias this competition until a single response is
               selected. The hypothesis suggests that the dorsal visual system

               fronto-parietal cortex, while a variety of biasing influences are
               provided by prefrontal regions and the basal ganglia. A

               through resource-poor regions alternate with zig-zag exploration
               in resource-rich domains. For example, during local search,
               flying flies spontaneously execute rapid flight turns, called
               body saccades, but suppress these maneuvers during long-distance
               dispersal or when surging upstream toward an attractive odor.
               Here, we describe the key cellular components of a neural network
               in flies that generate spontaneous turns as well as a specialized
               pair of neurons that inhibits the network and suppresses turning.
               Using 2-photon imaging, optogenetic activation, and genetic
               ablation, we show that only four descending neurons appear
               sufficient to generate the descending commands to execute flight
               saccades. The network is organized into two functional units-one
               for right turns and one for left-with each unit consisting of an
               excitatory (DNae014) and an inhibitory (DNb01) neuron that
               project to the flight motor neuropil within the ventral nerve
               cord. Using resources from recently published connectomes of the
               fly, we identified a pair of large, distinct interneurons
               (VES041) that form inhibitory connections to all four saccade
               command neurons and created specific genetic driver lines for
               this cell. As predicted by its connectivity, activation of VES041
               strongly suppresses saccades, suggesting that it promotes
               straight flight to regulate the transition between local search
               and long-distance dispersal. These results thus identify the key
               elements of a network that may play a crucial role in foraging

               somatosensory organ in the Drosophila leg, the femoral
               chordotonal organ (FeCO). The FeCO has been proposed to support
               both proprioceptive sensing of the fly's femur-tibia joint and

               which sensory neurons and central circuits contribute to each of
               these functions. We found that different subtypes of FeCO sensory

               the PDF-positive large (l-LNv) and small (s-LNv) ventral lateral

               molecules in mechanical nociception, but the cellular mechanisms
               adopted by nociceptors in force detection remain elusive. To

               female will make during her lifetime. A female fly signals her
               willingness to mate by opening her vaginal plates, allowing a
               courting male to copulate1,2. Vaginal plate opening (VPO) occurs
               in response to the male courtship song and is dependent on the
               mating status of the female. How these exteroceptive (song) and

               Drosophila melanogaster. We show that VPO is controlled by a pair
               of female-specific descending neurons (vpoDNs). The vpoDNs
               receive excitatory input from auditory neurons (vpoENs), which

               attenuated upon mating, accounting for the reduced receptivity of
               mated females. This modulation is mediated by pC1 neurons. The

               sensory responsiveness and endogenously generated behaviors.
               Biogenic amines have been determined to be causal factors for
               these states of arousal. It is well established that, in
               Drosophila, dopamine and octopamine promote increased arousal.
               However, little is known about factors that regulate arousal
               negatively and induce states of quiescence. Moreover, it remains
               unclear whether global, diffuse modulatory systems
               comprehensively affecting brain activity determine general states
               of arousal. Alternatively, individual aminergic neurons might
               selectively modulate the animals' activity in a distinct
               behavioral context. Here, we show that artificially activating
               large populations of serotonin-releasing neurons induces
               behavioral quiescence and inhibits feeding and mating. We
               systematically narrowed down a role of serotonin in inhibiting
               endogenously generated locomotor activity to neurons located in
               the posterior medial protocerebrum. We identified neurons of this
               cell cluster that suppress mating, but not feeding behavior.
               These results suggest that serotonin does not uniformly act as
               global, negative modulator of general arousal. Rather, distinct
               serotoninergic neurons can act as inhibitory modulators of
               specific behaviors. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: An animal's
               responsiveness to external stimuli and its various types of
               endogenously generated, motivated behavior are highly dynamic and
               change between states of high activity and states of low
               activity. It remains unclear whether these states are mediated by
               unitary modulatory systems globally affecting brain activity, or
               whether distinct neurons modulate specific neuronal circuits
               underlying particular types of behavior. Using the model organism
               Drosophila melanogaster, we find that activating large
               proportions of serotonin-releasing neurons induces behavioral
               quiescence. Moreover, distinct serotonin-releasing neurons that
               we genetically isolated and identified negatively affect aspects
               of mating behavior, but not food uptake. This demonstrates that
               individual serotoninergic neurons can modulate distinct types of
               behavior selectively.",

              ability to target arbitrarily small subsets of neurons for
              manipulation, but such specificity of targeting cannot routinely
              be achieved using existing methods. In Drosophila melanogaster, a
              widely-used technique for refined cell type-specific manipulation
              is the Split GAL4 system, which augments the targeting specificity
              of the binary GAL4-UAS (Upstream Activating Sequence) system by
              making GAL4 transcriptional activity contingent upon two

              acts by disrupting both the formation and activity of Split GAL4

               means loom-detecting neurons face the challenge of rejecting
               confounding stimuli. Here we report the discovery of an
               ultra-selective looming detecting neuron, lobula plate/lobula
               columnar, type II (LPLC2) in Drosophila, and show how its
               selectivity is established by radial motion opponency. In the fly
               visual system, directionally selective small-field neurons called
               T4 and T5 form a spatial map in the lobula plate, where they each
               terminate in one of four retinotopic layers, such that each layer
               responds to motion in a different cardinal direction. Single-cell
               anatomical analysis reveals that each arm of the LPLC2
               cross-shaped primary dendrites ramifies in one of these layers
               and extends along that layer's preferred motion direction. In
               vivo calcium imaging demonstrates that, as their shape predicts,
               individual LPLC2 neurons respond strongly to outward motion
               emanating from the centre of the neuron's receptive field. Each
               dendritic arm also receives local inhibitory inputs directionally
               selective for inward motion opposing the excitation. This radial
               motion opponency generates a balance of excitation and inhibition
               that makes LPLC2 non-responsive to related patterns of motion
               such as contraction, wide-field rotation or luminance change. As
               a population, LPLC2 neurons densely cover visual space and
               terminate onto the giant fibre descending neurons, which drive
               the jump muscle motor neuron to trigger an escape take off. Our
               findings provide a mechanistic description of the selective
               feature detection that flies use to discern and escape looming
               threats.",

               physiological changes in the female, including the onset of egg

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: In the fly's visual motion pathways, two cell
               types-T4 and T5-are the first known relay neurons to signal
               small-field direction-selective motion responses [1]. These cells
               then feed into large tangential cells that signal wide-field
               motion. Recent studies have identified two types of columnar
               neurons in the second neuropil, or medulla, that relay input to
               T4 from L1, the ON-channel neuron in the first neuropil, or
               lamina, thus providing a candidate substrate for the elementary
               motion detector (EMD) [2]. Interneurons relaying the OFF channel
               from L1's partner, L2, to T5 are so far not known, however.
               RESULTS: Here we report that multiple types of transmedulla (Tm)
               neurons provide unexpectedly complex inputs to T5 at their
               terminals in the third neuropil, or lobula. From the L2 pathway,
               single-column input comes from Tm1 and Tm2 and multiple-column
               input from Tm4 cells. Additional input to T5 comes from Tm9, the
               medulla target of a third lamina interneuron, L3, providing a
               candidate substrate for L3's combinatorial action with L2 [3].
               Most numerous, Tm2 and Tm9's input synapses are spatially
               segregated on T5's dendritic arbor, providing candidate
               anatomical substrates for the two arms of a T5 EMD circuit; Tm1
               and Tm2 provide a second. Transcript profiling indicates that T5
               expresses both nicotinic and muscarinic cholinoceptors,
               qualifying T5 to receive cholinergic inputs from Tm9 and Tm2,
               which both express choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). CONCLUSIONS:
               We hypothesize that T5 computes small-field motion signals by
               integrating multiple cholinergic Tm inputs using nicotinic and
               muscarinic cholinoceptors.",

               or functional perspective without reference to how the circuits

               candidate pathways for ON- and OFF-edge motion detection in the

               T5, two cell types of the fourth neuropil, or lobula plate (LOP),

               and that a fiber crossing-the internal chiasma-arose between the
               two neuropils. The split most plausibly occurred, we suggest,

               it separated from its ancestral neuropil to leave the ME,
               suggesting additionally that ME input neurons to T4 and T5 may
               also have had a common origin.",

              relatively small set of descending interneurons are responsible
              for conveying sensory information and higher-order commands from
              the brain to motor circuits in the ventral nerve cord. Here, we
              describe three pairs of genetically identified descending
              interneurons that integrate information from wide-field visual
              interneurons and project directly to motor centers controlling

              visual movement corresponding to rotation around three distinct
              body axes. After characterizing the tuning properties of an array

              interneuron class is correlated with a discrete set of motor
              programs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Most animals possess specialized
              sensory systems for encoding body rotation, which they use for
              stabilizing posture and regulating motor actions. In flies and
              other insects, the visual system contains an array of specialized
              neurons that integrate local optic flow to estimate body rotation
              during locomotion. However, the manner in which the output of

               Halting appropriately at the correct time is a critical component
               of walking control. Despite progress in identifying neurons
               driving halting1-6, the underlying neural circuit mechanisms
               responsible for overruling the competing walking state remain
               unclear. Here, using connectome-informed models7-9 and functional
               studies, we explain two fundamental mechanisms by which
               Drosophila implement context-appropriate halting. The first
               mechanism ('walk-OFF') relies on GABAergic neurons that inhibit
               specific descending walking commands in the brain, whereas the
               second mechanism ('brake') relies on excitatory cholinergic
               neurons in the nerve cord that lead to an active arrest of
               stepping movements. We show that two neurons that deploy the
               walk-OFF mechanism inhibit distinct populations of
               walking-promotion neurons, leading to differential halting of
               forward walking or turning. The brake neurons, by constrast,
               override all walking commands by simultaneously inhibiting
               descending walking-promotion neurons and increasing the
               resistance at the leg joints. We characterized two behavioural
               contexts in which the distinct halting mechanisms were used by
               the animal in a mutually exclusive manner: the walk-OFF mechanism
               was engaged for halting during feeding and the brake mechanism
               was engaged for halting and stability during grooming.",

              roles in aggression in a wide variety of animals. Previous
              investigations of 5HT function in adult Drosophila behavior have
              relied on pharmacological manipulations, or on combinations of
              genetic tools that simultaneously target both DA and 5HT neurons.
              Here, we generated a transgenic line that allows selective, direct
              manipulation of serotonergic neurons and asked whether DA and 5HT
              have separable effects on aggression. Quantitative morphological
              examination demonstrated that our newly generated tryptophan
              hydroxylase (TRH)-Gal4 driver line was highly selective for
              5HT-containing neurons. This line was used in conjunction with
              already available Gal4 driver lines that target DA or both DA and
              5HT neurons to acutely alter the function of aminergic systems.
              First, we showed that acute impairment of DA and 5HT
              neurotransmission using expression of a temperature sensitive form
              of dynamin completely abolished mid- and high-level aggression.
              These flies did not escalate fights beyond brief low-intensity
              interactions and therefore did not yield dominance relationships.
              We showed next that manipulation of either 5HT or DA
              neurotransmission failed to duplicate this phenotype. Selective
              disruption of 5HT neurotransmission yielded flies that fought, but
              with reduced ability to escalate fights, leading to fewer
              dominance relationships. Acute activation of 5HT neurons using
              temperature sensitive dTrpA1 channel expression, in contrast,
              resulted in flies that escalated fights faster and that fought at
              higher intensities. Finally, acute disruption of DA
              neurotransmission produced hyperactive flies that moved faster
              than controls, and rarely engaged in any social interactions. By
              separately manipulating 5HT- and DA- neuron systems, we collected
              evidence demonstrating a direct role for 5HT in the escalation of
              aggression in Drosophila.",

               This multilayered circuit is organized such that neurons within

              companion paper ([Takemura et al., 2023][1]), we describe the
              acquisition of a complete fruit fly nerve cord connectome, the
              first for an animal that can walk or fly. Here, to efficiently
              navigate and to appreciate the biological significance of this
              connectome, we categorise and name nearly all neurons
              systematically and link them to the experimental literature. We
              employ a system of hierarchical coarse annotations and group
              similar neurons across the midline and across segments, then
              define systematic cell types for sensory neurons, intrinsic
              neurons, ascending neurons, and non-motor efferent neurons.
              Stereotyped arrays of neuroblasts generate related neuron
              populations called hemilineages that repeat across the segments of
              the nerve cord. We confirm that larval-born neurons from a given
              hemilineage generally express the same neurotransmitter but find
              that earlier born neurons often express a different one. We match
              over 35\% of intrinsic, ascending, and non-motor efferent neurons
              across segments, defining serial sets which were crucial for
              systematic typing of motor neurons and sensory neurons. We assign
              a sensory modality to over 5000 sensory neurons, cluster them by
              connectivity, and identify serially homologous cell types and a
              layered organisation likely corresponding to peripheral

               from large-scale connectomics efforts using electron microscopy
               (EM) to reveal all the neurons in a brain and their connections.
               To exploit this knowledge base, researchers relate a connectome's
               structure to neuronal function, often by studying individual
               neuron cell types. Vast libraries of fly driver lines expressing
               fluorescent reporter genes in sets of neurons have been created
               and imaged using confocal light microscopy (LM), enabling the
               targeting of neurons for experimentation. However, creating a fly
               line for driving gene expression within a single neuron found in
               an EM connectome remains a challenge, as it typically requires
               identifying a pair of driver lines where only the neuron of
               interest is expressed in both. This task and other emerging
               scientific workflows require finding similar neurons across large
               data sets imaged using different modalities. RESULTS: Here, we

              activity is coordinated by complex premotor networks that
              facilitate the contribution of individual muscles to many
              different behaviours2-6. Here we use connectomics7 to analyse the

              that link MNs innervating muscles with related functions. Within
              most leg motor modules, the synaptic weights of each premotor
              neuron are proportional to the size of their target MNs,
              establishing a circuit basis for hierarchical MN recruitment. By
              contrast, wing premotor networks lack proportional synaptic
              connectivity, which may enable more flexible recruitment of wing
              steering muscles. Through comparison of the architecture of

              mammalian sleep. Characteristic rhythms are associated with
              different sleep stages and variable levels of sleep pressure, but
              it remains unclear whether these oscillations are passive mirrors
              or active generators of sleep. Here we report that sleep-control
              neurons innervating the dorsal fan-shaped body ofDrosophila(dFBNs)
              produce slow-wave activity (SWA) in the delta frequency band
              (0.2–1 Hz) that is causally linked to sleep. The dFBN ensemble
              contains one or two rhythmic cells per hemisphere whose membrane
              voltages oscillate in anti-phase between hyperpolarized DOWN and
              depolarized UP states releasing bursts of action potentials. The
              oscillations rely on direct interhemispheric competition of two
              inhibitory half-centres connected by glutamatergic synapses.
              Interference with glutamate release from these synapses disrupts
              SWA and baseline as well as rebound sleep, while the optogenetic
              replay of SWA (with the help of an intersectional, dFBN-restricted
              driver) induces sleep. Rhythmic dFBNs generate SWA throughout the
              sleep–wake cycle—despite a mutually antagonistic ‘flip-flop’
              arrangement with arousing dopaminergic neurons—but adjust its
              power to sleep need via an interplay of sleep history-dependent
              increases in dFBN excitability and homeostatic depression of their
              efferent synapses, as we demonstrate transcriptionally,
              structurally, functionally, and with a simple computational model.
              The oscillatory format permits a durable encoding of sleep
              pressure over long time scales but requires downstream mechanisms
              that convert the amplitude-modulated periodic signal into binary

               against disturbances and change direction to avoid obstacles and

               sensory cues but also depends on intrinsic processes, such as
               motivation and physiological state. Flies, for example, turn with
               the direction of large-field rotatory motion, an optomotor reflex
               that is thought to help them fly straight [3-5]. Occasionally,
               however, they execute fast turns, called body saccades, either
               spontaneously or in response to patterns of visual motion such as
               expansion [6-8]. These turns can be measured in tethered flying
               Drosophila [3, 4, 9], which facilitates the study of underlying
               neural mechanisms. Whereas there is evidence for an efference
               copy input to visual interneurons during saccades [10], the
               circuits that control spontaneous and visually elicited saccades

               with both spontaneous and visually elicited turns during tethered
               flight. The cell's activity in open- and closed-loop experiments
               suggests that it does not underlie slower compensatory responses
               to horizontal motion but rather controls rapid changes in flight
               path. The activity of this neuron can explain some of the
               behavioral variability observed in response to visual motion and
               appears sufficient for eliciting turns when artificially
               activated. This work provides an entry point into studying the
               circuits underlying the control of rapid steering maneuvers in

              (Refinetti and Menaker, 1992) and decreases during the night,
              which is associated with sleep initiation (Gilbert et al., 2004;
              Kräuchi, 2007a,b). However, the underlying mechanism of this
              temperature decrease is largely unknown. We have previously shown
              that Drosophila exhibit a daily temperature preference rhythm
              (TPR), in which their preferred temperatures increase during the
              daytime and then decrease at the transition from day to night
              (night-onset) (Kaneko et al., 2012). Because Drosophila are small
              ectotherms, their body temperature is very close to that of the
              ambient temperature (Stevenson, 1985), suggesting that their TPR
              generates their body temperature rhythm. Here, we demonstrate that
              the neuropeptide diuretic hormone 31 (DH31) and pigment-dispersing
              factor receptor (PDFR) contribute to regulate the preferred
              temperature decrease at night-onset. We show that PDFR and
              tethered-DH31 expression in dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s) restore the
              preferred temperature decrease at night-onset, suggesting that
              DH31 acts on PDFR in DN2s. Notably, we previously showed that the
              molecular clock in DN2s is important for TPR. Although PDF
              (another ligand of PDFR) is a critical factor for locomotor
              activity rhythms, Pdf mutants exhibit normal preferred temperature
              decreases at night-onset. This suggests that DH31-PDFR signaling
              specifically regulates a preferred temperature decrease at
              night-onset. Thus, we propose that night-onset TPR and locomotor
              activity rhythms are differentially controlled not only by clock
              neurons but also by neuropeptide signaling in the brain.
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Body temperature rhythm (BTR) is
              fundamental for the maintenance of functions essential for
              homeostasis, such as generating metabolic energy and sleep. One
              major unsolved question is how body temperature decreases
              dramatically during the night. Previously, we demonstrated that a
              BTR-like mechanism, referred to as temperature preference rhythm
              (TPR), exists in Drosophila Here, we demonstrate that the diuretic
              hormone 31 (DH31) neuropeptide and pigment-dispersing factor
              receptor (PDFR) regulate preferred temperature decreases at
              night-onset via dorsal neurons 2. This is the first in vivo
              evidence that DH31 could function as a ligand of PDFR. Although
              both DH31 and PDF are ligands of PDFR, we show that DH31 regulates
              night-onset TPR, but PDF does not, suggesting that night-onset TPR
              and locomotor activity rhythms are controlled by different
              neuropeptides via different clock cells.",

               cerebellum-like circuits, including the insect mushroom body,
               also exhibit large divergences in connectivity. In contrast, the
               number of inputs per neuron in cerebral cortex is more uniform
               and large. We investigate how the dimension of a representation
               formed by a population of neurons depends on how many inputs each
               neuron receives and what this implies for learning associations.
               Our theory predicts that the dimensions of the cerebellar
               granule-cell and Drosophila Kenyon-cell representations are
               maximized at degrees of synaptic connectivity that match those
               observed anatomically, showing that sparse connectivity is
               sometimes superior to dense connectivity. When input synapses are
               subject to supervised plasticity, however, dense wiring becomes
               advantageous, suggesting that the type of plasticity exhibited by
               a set of synapses is a major determinant of connection density.",

               Drosophila mushroom body with in vivo calcium imaging and
               conditional silencing of genetically defined subsets of neurons.
               Distinct subsets of PPL1 dopaminergic neurons innervating the
               vertical lobes of the mushroom body responded to decreases in
               temperature, but not increases, with rapidly adapting bursts of
               activity. PAM neurons innervating the horizontal lobes did not
               respond to temperature shifts. Ablation of the antennae and
               maxillary palps reduced, but did not eliminate, the responses.
               Genetic silencing of dopaminergic neurons innervating the

               cold avoidance, but silencing smaller subsets of these neurons

               command-like neurons that are sufficient to drive behaviours1-the

               control of numerous body parts. Specifically, we found that
               command-like DNs previously thought to drive behaviours alone2-4
               in fact co-activate larger populations of DNs. Connectome
               analyses and experimental manipulations revealed that this
               functional recruitment can be explained by direct excitatory
               connections between command-like DNs and networks of
               interconnected DNs in the brain. Descending population
               recruitment is necessary for behavioural control: DNs with many

               drive complete behaviours and drive only simple stereotyped

               in which behaviours are generated through the recruitment of

               the head direction vector, such that their three reference frames
               are shifted approximately 120° relative to each other. Each cell
               type then compares its own head direction vector with a common
               goal vector; specifically, it evaluates the congruence of these
               vectors via a nonlinear transformation. The output of all three
               cell populations is then combined to generate locomotor commands.
               PFL3R cells are recruited when the fly is oriented to the left of
               its goal, and their activity drives rightward turning; the
               reverse is true for PFL3L. Meanwhile, PFL2 cells increase
               steering speed, and are recruited when the fly is oriented far
               from its goal. PFL2 cells adaptively increase the strength of
               steering as directional error increases, effectively managing the
               tradeoff between speed and accuracy. Together, our results show
               how a map of space in the brain can be combined with an internal
               goal to generate action commands, via a transformation from
               world-centric coordinates to body-centric coordinates.",

              Whether these ``body saccades'' are accompanied by steering
              movements of the head is a matter of debate. By tracking single
              flies moving freely in an arena, we now discovered that walking
              Drosophila also perform saccades. Movement analysis revealed that
              the flies separate rotational from translational movements by
              quickly turning their bodies by 15 degrees within a tenth of a
              second. Although walking flies moved their heads by up to 20
              degrees about their bodies, their heads moved with the bodies
              during saccadic turns. This saccadic strategy contrasts with the
              head saccades reported for e.g., blowflies and honeybees,
              presumably reflecting optical constraints: modeling revealed that
              head saccades as described for these latter insects would hardly
              affect the retinal input in Drosophila because of the lower acuity
              of its compound eye. The absence of head saccades in Drosophila
              was associated with the absence of haltere oscillations, which
              seem to guide head movements in other flies. In addition to adding
              new twists to Drosophila walking behavior, our analysis shows that

               regions and local neurons that shape computation within a brain
               region form the majority of all neurons in the brain. Another
               important class of neurons is neuromodulatory neurons; these
               neurons are in much smaller numbers than projection/local neurons
               but have a large influence on computations in the brain.
               Neuromodulatory neurons are classified by the neurotransmitters
               they carry, such as dopamine and serotonin. Much of our knowledge
               of the effect of neuromodulators comes from experiments in which
               either a large population of neuromodulatory neurons or the
               entire population is perturbed. Alternatively, a given
               neuromodulator is exogenously applied. While these experiments
               are informative of the general role of the neurotransmitter, one
               limitation of these experiments is that the role of individual
               neuromodulatory neurons remains unknown. In this study, we
               investigate the role of a class of octopaminergic (octopamine is
               the invertebrate equivalent of norepinephrine) neurons in
               Drosophila or fruit fly. Neuromodulation in Drosophila work along
               similar principles as humans; and the smaller number of
               neuromodulatory neurons allow us to assess the role of individual
               neurons. This study focuses on a subpopulation of octopaminergic
               descending neurons (OA-DNs) whose cell bodies are in the brain
               and project to the thoracic ganglia. Using in-vivo whole-cell

               compare light microscopy data to the electron microscopic volumes
               available in the fly, we find that neurons within each cluster
               have similar physiological properties, including their relation
               to locomotion. However, neurons in the same cluster with similar
               anatomy have very different connectivity. Our data is consistent
               with the hypothesis that each OA-DN is recruited individually and
               has a unique function within the fly's brain.",

               Although light intensity varies across the day, there are
               particularly robust differences at twilight (dawn/dusk). These
               periods are also associated with major changes in behavioral
               states, such as the transition from arousal to sleep. However,
               the neural mechanisms by which time and environmental conditions
               promote these behavioral transitions are poorly defined. Here, we
               show that the E1 subclass of Drosophila evening clock neurons
               promotes the transition from arousal to sleep at dusk. We first
               demonstrate that the cell-autonomous clocks of E2 neurons
               primarily drive and adjust the phase of evening anticipation, the
               canonical behavior associated with ``evening'' clock neurons. We
               next show that conditionally silencing E1 neurons causes a
               significant delay in sleep onset after dusk. However, rather than
               simply promoting sleep, activating E1 neurons produces time- and
               light-dependent effects on behavior. Activation of E1 neurons has
               no effect early in the day but then triggers arousal before dusk
               and induces sleep after dusk. Strikingly, these
               activation-induced phenotypes depend on the presence of light
               during the day. Despite their influence on behavior around dusk,
               in vivo voltage imaging of E1 neurons reveals that their spiking
               rate and pattern do not significantly change throughout the day.
               Moreover, E1-specific clock ablation has no effect on arousal or
               sleep. Thus, we suggest that, rather than specifying ``evening''
               time, E1 neurons act, in concert with other rhythmic neurons, to
               promote behavioral transitions at dusk.",

               rules of connectivity between cell types have already proven to
               be essential for understanding fly vision4,5. Here we analyse the
               fly connectome to complete the list of cell types intrinsic to
               the optic lobe, as well as the rules governing their
               connectivity. Most new cell types contain 10 to 100 cells, and
               integrate information over medium distances in the visual field.
               Some existing type families (Tm, Li, and LPi)6-10 at least double
               in number of types. A new serpentine medulla (Sm) interneuron

               catalyzed by Tyramine beta-hydroxylase enzyme (TBH). The Tbetah
               gene has been previously cloned from Drosophila melanogaster, and
               null mutations have been generated resulting in octopamine-less
               flies that show profound female sterility. Here, I show that
               ovulation process is defective in the mutant females resulting in
               blockage of mature oocytes within the ovaries. The phenotype is
               conditionally rescued by expressing a Tbetah cDNA under the

              Leveraging a whole-brain electron microscopy volume, we studied
              the adult Drosophila melanogaster circuitry associated with
              antennal thermo- and hygrosensory neurons. We have identified two
              new target glomeruli in the antennal lobe, in addition to the five
              known ones, and the ventroposterior projection neurons (VP PNs)
              that relay thermo- and hygrosensory information to higher brain
              centers, including the mushroom body and lateral horn, seats of
              learned and innate behavior. We present the first connectome of a
              thermo- and hygrosensory neuropil, the lateral accessory calyx
              (lACA), by reconstructing neurons downstream of heating- and
              cooling-responsive VP PNs. A few mushroom body-intrinsic neurons
              solely receive thermosensory input from the lACA, while most
              receive additional olfactory and thermo- and/or hygrosensory PN
              inputs. Furthermore, several classes of lACA-associated neurons
              form a local network with outputs to other brain neuropils,
              suggesting that the lACA serves as a hub for thermo- and
              hygrosensory circuitry. For example, DN1a neurons link
              thermosensory PNs in the lACA to the circadian clock via the
              accessory medulla. Finally, we survey strongly connected
              downstream partners of VP PNs across the protocerebrum; these
              include a descending neuron targeted by dry-responsive VP PNs,
              meaning that just two synapses might separate hygrosensory inputs
              from motor circuits. These data provide a comprehensive first- and
              second-order layer analysis of Drosophila thermo- and hygrosensory
              systems and an initial survey of third-order neurons that could

               Because DNs arise from multiple circuits in the brain, the
               numerical simplicity and availability of genetic tools make
               Drosophila a tractable model for understanding descending motor
               control. As a first step towards a comprehensive study of
               descending motor control, here we estimate the number and
               distribution of DNs in the Drosophila brain. We labeled DNs by
               backfilling them with dextran dye applied to the neck connective
               and estimated that there are ~1100 DNs distributed in 6 clusters
               in Drosophila. To assess the distribution of DNs by
               neurotransmitters, we labeled DNs in flies in which neurons
               expressing the major neurotransmitters were also labeled. We
               found DNs belonging to every neurotransmitter class we tested:

               However, it is not known how flies evaluate substances that have

              critical for distinguishing between nutritious and potentially

               which modulate this output on a cycle-to-cycle basis. How this

               different coordination patterns observed at different speeds is
               not sufficiently understood. Here, we used amputation to reduce
               sensory signals in single legs and decouple them mechanically
               during walking in Drosophila. This allowed for the dissociation
               between locally generated motor output in the stump and
               coordinating influences from intact legs. Leg stumps were still
               rhythmically active during walking. Although the oscillatory
               frequency in intact legs was dependent on walking speed, stumps
               showed a high and relatively constant oscillation frequency at
               all walking speeds. At low walking speeds we found no strict

               contrast, at high walking speeds stump oscillations were strongly

               Although during slow walking there was no preferred phase between

               interval between touch-down or lift-off events in intact legs and

               hypothesize that, as in other insects, walking speed in
               Drosophila is predominantly controlled by indirect mechanisms and
               that direct modulation of basic pattern-generating circuits plays
               a subsidiary role. Furthermore, inter-leg coordination strength

               gene, but we currently lack an appreciation of the cellular
               diversity within this population, the extent to which these cells
               are sexually dimorphic, and how they might be organized into
               functional circuits. RESULTS: We used genetic methods to define
               100 distinct classes of fru neuron, which we compiled into a
               digital 3D atlas at cellular resolution. We determined the
               polarity of many of these neurons and computed their likely
               patterns of connectivity, thereby assembling them into a neural
               circuit that extends from sensory input to motor output. The
               cellular organization of this circuit reveals neuronal pathways
               in the brain that are likely to integrate multiple sensory cues
               from other flies and to issue descending control signals to motor
               circuits in the thoracic ganglia. We identified 11 anatomical
               dimorphisms within this circuit: neurons that are male specific,
               are more numerous in males than females, or have distinct
               arborization patterns in males and females. CONCLUSIONS: The
               cellular organization of the fru circuit suggests how multiple
               distinct sensory cues are integrated in the fly's brain to drive
               sex-specific courtship behavior. We propose that sensory
               processing and motor control are mediated through circuits that
               are largely similar in males and females. Sex-specific behavior
               may instead arise through dimorphic circuits in the brain and

               information about internal state to the CNS to maintain
               physiological homeostasis. Despite their conservation across
               species, the anatomy, circuitry, and development of internal
               sensory systems are still relatively poorly understood. A largely
               unstudied population of larval Drosophila sensory neurons, termed
               tracheal dendrite (td) neurons, innervate internal respiratory
               organs and may serve as a model for understanding the sensing of
               internal states. Here, we characterize the peripheral anatomy,
               central axon projection, and diversity of td sensory neurons. We
               provide evidence for prominent expression of specific gustatory
               receptor genes in distinct populations of td neurons, suggesting
               novel chemosensory functions. We identify two anatomically
               distinct classes of td neurons. The axons of one class project to
               the subesophageal zone (SEZ) in the brain, whereas the other
               terminates in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We identify
               expression and a developmental role of the POU-homeodomain
               transcription factor Pdm3 in regulating the axon extension and
               terminal targeting of SEZ-projecting td neurons. Remarkably,
               ectopic Pdm3 expression is alone sufficient to switch
               VNC-targeting axons to SEZ targets, and to induce the formation
               of putative synapses in these ectopic target zones. Our data thus
               define distinct classes of td neurons, and identify a molecular
               factor that contributes to diversification of axon targeting.
               These results introduce a tractable model to elucidate molecular
               and circuit mechanisms underlying sensory processing of internal

               How interoceptive sensory circuits develop, including how sensory
               neurons diversify and target distinct central regions, is still
               poorly understood, despite the importance of these sensory
               systems for maintaining physiological homeostasis. Here, we
               characterize classes of Drosophila internal sensory neurons (td
               neurons) and uncover diverse axonal projections and expression of
               chemosensory receptor genes. We categorize td neurons into two
               classes based on dichotomous axon target regions, and identify
               the expression and role of the transcription factor Pdm3 in
               mediating td axon targeting to one of these target regions. Our
               results provide an entry point into studying internal sensory
               circuit development and function, and establish Pdm3 as a
               regulator of interoceptive axon targeting.",

               hinge on accurate statistical models of population activity. A
               novel class of models, based on learning to weigh sparse
               nonlinear Random Projections (RP) of the population, has
               demonstrated high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.
               Importantly, these RP models have a clear and biologically
               plausible implementation as shallow neural networks. We present a
               new class of RP models that are learned by optimizing the
               randomly selected sparse projections themselves. This 'reshaping'
               of projections is akin to changing synaptic connections in just
               one layer of the corresponding neural circuit model. We show that
               Reshaped RP models are more accurate and efficient than the
               standard RP models in recapitulating the code of tens of cortical
               neurons from behaving monkeys. Incorporating more biological
               features and utilizing synaptic normalization in the learning
               process, results in accurate models that are more efficient.
               Remarkably, these models exhibit homeostasis in firing rates and
               total synaptic weights of projection neurons. We further show
               that these sparse homeostatic reshaped RP models outperform fully
               connected neural network models. Thus, our new scalable,
               efficient, and highly accurate population code models are not
               only biologically plausible but are actually optimized due to
               their biological features. These findings suggest a dual

               maintaining spiking and synaptic homeostasis while concurrently

              during rapid flight. Neurons that respond to specific, large-field
              optic flow patterns have been studied for decades, primarily in
              large flies, such as houseflies, blowflies, and hover flies. The
              best-known optic-flow sensitive neurons are the large tangential
              cells of the dipteran lobula plate, whose visual-motion responses,
              and to a lesser extent, their morphology, have been explored using
              single-neuron neurophysiology. Most of these studies have focused
              on the large, Horizontal and Vertical System neurons, yet the

              neurons, many of which have been challenging to unambiguously

              Lobula Plate Tangential Neurons in an Electron Microscopy (EM)
              volume of a whole Drosophila brain. This catalog of 58 LPT neurons

              here for the first time and provides a basis for systematic
              investigation of the circuitry linking self-motion to locomotion
              control. Leveraging computational anatomy methods, we estimated
              the visual motion receptive fields of these neurons and compared

              genetic driver lines, to the mirror-symmetric neurons in the same
              EM brain volume, and to neurons in an additional EM data set.
              Using cell matches across data sets, we analyzed the integration
              of optic flow patterns by neurons downstream of the LPTs and find
              that most central brain neurons establish sharper selectivity for

              reafferent sources. Nevertheless, animals readily differentiate
              between these sources of sensory signals to carry out adaptive

              approaches to resolve the network architecture of two pairs of
              ascending histaminergic neurons (AHNs) in Drosophila, which
              function as a predictive CDC in other insects. Both AHN pairs

              non-overlapping sensory and motor networks. Future work will
              determine how AHN signaling is driven by other descending neurons

               known about the neural or molecular basis underlying the
               integration of these processes. D. melanogaster potently suppress
               sleep in response to starvation, and powerful genetic tools allow
               for mechanistic investigation of sleep-metabolism interactions.
               We have previously identified neurons expressing the neuropeptide
               leucokinin (Lk) as being required for starvation-mediated changes
               in sleep. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for Lk
               neuropeptide in metabolic regulation of sleep. The activity of Lk
               neurons is modulated by feeding, with reduced activity in
               response to glucose and increased activity under starvation
               conditions. Both genetic silencing and laser-mediated
               microablation localize Lk-dependent sleep regulation to a single
               pair of Lk neurons within the Lateral Horn (LHLK neurons). A
               targeted screen identified a role for 5' adenosine
               monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in
               starvation-modulated changes in sleep. Knockdown of AMPK in Lk
               neurons suppresses sleep and increases LHLK neuron activity in
               fed flies, phenocopying the starvation state. Further, we find a
               requirement for the Lk receptor in the insulin-producing cells
               (IPCs), suggesting LHLK-IPC connectivity is critical for sleep
               regulation under starved conditions. Taken together, these
               findings localize feeding-state-dependent regulation of sleep to
               a single pair of neurons within the fruit fly brain and provide a

                   recursively, the regions are divided into chunks that are

               memory retention and ethanol sensitivity. The predicted amnesiac
               gene product, AMN, is an apparent preproneuropeptide, and
               previous studies suggest that it stimulates cAMP synthesis. Here
               we show that, unlike other learning-related Drosophila proteins,
               AMN is not preferentially expressed in mushroom bodies. Instead,
               it is strongly expressed in two large neurons that project over
               all the lobes of the mushroom bodies, a finding that suggests a
               modulatory role for AMN in memory formation. Genetically
               engineered blockade of vesicle recycling in these cells
               abbreviates memory as in the amnesiac mutant. Moreover,
               restoration of amn gene expression to these cells reestablishes
               normal olfactory memory in an amn deletion background. These
               results indicate that AMN neuropeptide release onto the mushroom
               bodies is critical for normal olfactory memory.",

              flow and also to guide genetic manipulations aimed at
              understanding how genes and circuits orchestrate complex
              behaviors. RESULTS To assemble this map, we deconstructed the
              adult Drosophila brain into approximately 16,000 single neurons
              and reconstructed them into a common standardized framework to
              produce a virtual fly brain. We have constructed a mesoscopic map
              and found that it consists of 41 local processing units (LPUs),
              six hubs, and 58 tracts covering the whole Drosophila brain.
              Despite individual local variation, the architecture of the
              Drosophila brain shows invariance for both the aggregation of
              local neurons (LNs) within specific LPUs and for the connectivity
              of projection neurons (PNs) between the same set of LPUs. An

              Influential theories of cerebellar information processing have

               peptide (SP) during copulation mediates these postmating

               circuitry that is involved with vibrissa-mediated sensation and
               the control of rhythmic vibrissa movement. Anatomical evidence
               points to a multiplicity of closed sensorimotor loops, while
               electrophysiological data delineate the flow of electrical
               signals in these pathways. These loops process sensory input from
               the vibrissae and send projections to direct vibrissa movement,
               starting at the level of the hindbrain and proceeding toward
               loops that involve multiple structures in the forebrain. The
               nature of the vibrissa-related electrical signals in behaving
               animals has been studied extensively at the level of neocortical
               loops. Two types of spike signal are observed that serve as a
               reference of vibrissa motion: a fast signal that correlates with
               the relative phase of the vibrissae within a whisk cycle and a
               slow signal that correlates with the amplitude, and possibly the
               set-point, of the vibrissae during a whisk. Both signals are
               observed in vibrissa primary sensory (S1) cortex, and in some
               cases they are sufficiently robust to allow vibrissa position to
               be accurately estimated from the spike train of a single neuron.
               Unlike the case for S1 cortex, only the slow signal has been
               observed in vibrissa primary motor (M1) cortex. The control
               capabilities of M1 cortex were estimated from experiments with
               anesthetized animals in which progressive areas along the
               vibrissa motor branch were microstimulated with rhythmically
               applied currents. The motion of the vibrissae followed
               stimulation of M1 cortex only for rates that were well below the
               frequency of rhythmic whisking; in contrast, the vibrissae
               followed stimulation of the facial nucleus, whose cells directly
               drive the vibrissae, for rates above that of whisking. In toto,
               the evidence implies that there is fast signaling from the facial
               nucleus, through the mystacial pad and the vibrissae and up
               through sensory cortex, but only slow signaling at the level of
               the motor cortex and down through the superior colliculus to the
               facial nucleus. The transformation from fast sensory signals to
               slow motor control is an unresolved issue. On the other hand,
               there is a candidate scheme to understand how the fast reference
               of vibrissa motion in the whisk cycle may be used to decode the
               angle of the vibrissae upon their contact with an object. We
               discuss a circuit in which servo mechanisms are used to determine
               the angle of contact relative to the preferred phase of the fast
               reference signals. Support for this scheme comes from results
               with anesthetized animals on the frequency and phase entrainment
               of intrinsic neuronal oscillators in S1 cortex. A prediction
               based on this scheme is that the output from a decoder circuit is

              stream of information about the body's translational velocity from
              motor commands and sensory feedback signals. These incoming
              signals are referenced to the body, but ultimately, they must be
              transformed into world-centric coordinates for navigation1,2. Here
              we show that this computation occurs in the fan-shaped body in the
              brain of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify two cell types, PFNd
              and PFNv3-5, that conjunctively encode translational velocity and
              heading as a fly walks. In these cells, velocity signals are
              acquired from locomotor brain regions6 and are multiplied with
              heading signals from the compass system. PFNd neurons prefer
              forward-ipsilateral movement, whereas PFNv neurons prefer
              backward-contralateral movement, and perturbing PFNd neurons
              disrupts idiothetic path integration in walking flies7.
              Downstream, PFNd and PFNv neurons converge onto hΔB neurons, with
              a connectivity pattern that pools together heading and translation
              direction combinations corresponding to the same movement in
              world-centric space. This network motif effectively performs a
              rotation of the brain's representation of body-centric
              translational velocity according to the current heading direction.
              Consistent with our predictions, we observe that hΔB neurons form
              a representation of translational velocity in world-centric
              coordinates. By integrating this representation over time, it
              should be possible for the brain to form a working memory of the

               attached rigidly to the exoskeleton. A natural assumption is that
               all of these species must resort to moving either their head or
               their body to actively change their visual input. However,
               classic anatomy has revealed that flies have muscles poised to
               move their retinas under the stable lenses of each compound
               eye1-3. Here we show that Drosophila use their retinal muscles to
               smoothly track visual motion, which helps to stabilize the
               retinal image, and also to perform small saccades when viewing a
               stationary scene. We show that when the retina moves, visual
               receptive fields shift accordingly, and that even the smallest
               retinal saccades activate visual neurons. Using a head-fixed
               behavioural paradigm, we find that Drosophila perform binocular,
               vergence movements of their retinas-which could enhance depth

               retinal motor neurons alters gap-crossing trajectories during

               ethologically relevant stimuli and guiding motor responses3-5.
               How circuitry converts object location in retinal coordinates to
               movement direction in body coordinates remains largely unknown.
               Here we show through behaviour, physiology, anatomy and
               connectomics in Drosophila that visuomotor transformation occurs
               by conversion of topographic maps formed by the dendrites of
               feature-detecting visual projection neurons (VPNs)6,7 into
               synaptic weight gradients of VPN outputs onto central brain
               neurons. We demonstrate how this gradient motif transforms the
               anteroposterior location of a visual looming stimulus into the
               fly's directional escape. Specifically, we discover that two
               neurons postsynaptic to a looming-responsive VPN type promote
               opposite takeoff directions. Opposite synaptic weight gradients
               onto these neurons from looming VPNs in different visual field
               regions convert localized looming threats into correctly oriented
               escapes. For a second looming-responsive VPN type, we demonstrate
               graded responses along the dorsoventral axis. We show that this
               synaptic gradient motif generalizes across all 20 primary VPN
               cell types and most often arises without VPN axon topography.
               Synaptic gradients may thus be a general mechanism for conveying
               spatial features of sensory information into directed motor
               outputs.",

               untangle how neurons interact with each other and coordinate in
               large-scale recurrent networks. One way to address this question
               is to measure the functional influence of individual neurons on
               each other by perturbing them in vivo. Application of such
               single-neuron perturbations in mouse visual cortex has recently
               revealed feature-specific suppression between excitatory neurons,
               despite the presence of highly specific excitatory connectivity,
               which was deemed to underlie feature-specific amplification.
               Here, we studied which connectivity profiles are consistent with
               these seemingly contradictory observations, by modeling the
               effect of single-neuron perturbations in large-scale neuronal
               networks. Our numerical simulations and mathematical analysis
               revealed that, contrary to the prima facie assumption, neither
               inhibition dominance nor broad inhibition alone were sufficient
               to explain the experimental findings; instead, strong and
               functionally specific excitatory-inhibitory connectivity was
               necessary, consistent with recent findings in the primary visual
               cortex of rodents. Such networks had a higher capacity to encode
               and decode natural images, and this was accompanied by the
               emergence of response gain nonlinearities at the population
               level. Our study provides a general computational framework to
               investigate how single-neuron perturbations are linked to

               sets of neurons that commonly constitute a small fraction of the
               total number of neurons. However, some neuropeptide genes are
               expressed in larger numbers of neurons of diverse types
               suggesting that they are involved in a greater diversity of
               functions. One of these widely expressed genes, snpf, encodes the
               precursor of short neuropeptide F (sNPF). To unravel possible
               functional diversity we have mapped the distribution of
               transcript of the snpf gene and its peptide products in the
               central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila in relation to other
               neuronal markers. RESULTS: There are several hundreds of neurons
               in the larval CNS and several thousands in the adult Drosophila
               brain expressing snpf transcript and sNPF peptide. Most of these
               neurons are intrinsic interneurons of the mushroom bodies.
               Additionally, sNPF is expressed in numerous small interneurons of
               the CNS, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of the antennae, and
               in a small set of possibly neurosecretory cells innervating the
               corpora cardiaca and aorta. A sNPF-Gal4 line confirms most of the
               expression pattern. None of the sNPF immunoreactive neurons
               co-express a marker for the transcription factor DIMMED,
               suggesting that the majority are not neurosecretory cells or
               large interneurons involved in episodic bulk transmission.
               Instead a portion of the sNPF producing neurons co-express
               markers for classical neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine,
               GABA and glutamate, suggesting that sNPF is a co-transmitter or
               local neuromodulator in ORNs and many interneurons.
               Interestingly, sNPF is coexpressed both with presumed excitatory
               and inhibitory neurotransmitters. A few sNPF expressing neurons
               in the brain colocalize the peptide corazonin and a pair of
               dorsal neurons in the first abdominal neuromere coexpresses sNPF
               and insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7). CONCLUSION: It is likely that
               sNPF has multiple functions as neurohormone as well as local
               neuromodulator/co-transmitter in various CNS circuits, including
               olfactory circuits both at the level of the first synapse and at
               the mushroom body output level. Some of the sNPF immunoreactive
               axons terminate in close proximity to neurosecretory cells
               producing ILPs and adipokinetic hormone, indicating that sNPF
               also might regulate hormone production or release.",

              we compare the functional anatomy of the insect central complex
              and vertebrate basal ganglia to illustrate their role in mediating
              selection and maintenance of adaptive behaviours. Comparative
              analyses reveal that central complex and basal ganglia circuitries
              share comparable lineage relationships within clusters of
              functionally integrated neurons. These clusters are specified by
              genetic mechanisms that link birth time and order to their
              neuronal identities and functions. Their subsequent connections

               of behavioral rhythms for the ion transport peptide (ITP), which
               is expressed in the fifth small ventral lateral neuron, one
               dorsal lateral neuron, and in only a few nonclock cells in the
               brain. Immunocytochemical analyses revealed that ITP, like PDF,
               is most probably released in a rhythmic manner at projection
               terminals in the dorsal protocerebrum. This rhythm continues
               under constant dark conditions, indicating that ITP release is
               clock controlled. ITP expression is reduced in the hypomorph
               mutant Clk(AR), suggesting that ITP expression is regulated by
               CLOCK. Using a genetically encoded RNAi construct, we knocked
               down ITP in the two clock cells and found that these flies show
               reduced evening activity and increased nocturnal activity.
               Overexpression of ITP with two independent timeless-GAL4 lines
               completely disrupted behavioral rhythms, but only slightly
               dampened PER cycling in important pacemaker neurons, suggesting a
               role for ITP in clock output pathways rather than in the
               communication within the clock network. Simultaneous knockdown
               (KD) of ITP and PDF made the flies hyperactive and almost
               completely arrhythmic under constant conditions. Under light-dark
               conditions, the double-KD combined the behavioral characteristics
               of the single-KD flies. In addition, it reduced the flies' sleep.
               We conclude that ITP and PDF are the clock's main output signals
               that cooperate in controlling the flies' activity rhythms.",

               in a given direction by activating a fixed set of motor neurons,
               the brain controls movements by adding bias to a continuing
               proprioceptive-motor loop.",

               factors (TFs) to the cognate binding sites in the region.
               However, the role of multiple binding sites for the same TFs and
               their specific spatial arrangement in determining the overall
               competency of the enhancer has yet to be fully understood. In
               this study, we utilized the MS2-MCP live imaging technique to
               quantitatively analyze the regulatory logic of the snail distal

               modulation of Dorsal and Twist binding motifs in this enhancer,

               a drastic reduction in transcriptional amplitude, resulting in a
               reduction in mRNA production of the target gene. We provide
               evidence of synergy, such that multiple binding sites with
               moderate affinities cooperatively recruit more TFs to drive

               behaviour is lacking. Here we characterize a neuronal circuit in
               the Drosophila central complex that compares internally generated
               estimates of the heading and goal angles of the fly-both of which
               are encoded in world-centred (allocentric) coordinates-to
               generate a body-centred (egocentric) steering signal. Past work
               has suggested that the activity of EPG neurons represents the
               fly's moment-to-moment angular orientation, or heading angle,
               during navigation2,11. An animal's moment-to-moment heading
               angle, however, is not always aligned with its goal angle-that
               is, the allocentric direction in which it wishes to progress
               forward. We describe FC2 cells12, a second set of neurons in the
               Drosophila brain with activity that correlates with the fly's
               goal angle. Focal optogenetic activation of FC2 neurons induces
               flies to orient along experimenter-defined directions as they
               walk forward. EPG and FC2 neurons connect monosynaptically to a
               third neuronal class, PFL3 cells12,13. We found that individual
               PFL3 cells show conjunctive, spike-rate tuning to both the
               heading angle and the goal angle during goal-directed navigation.
               Informed by the anatomy and physiology of these three cell
               classes, we develop a model that explains how this circuit
               compares allocentric heading and goal angles to build an
               egocentric steering signal in the PFL3 output terminals.
               Quantitative analyses and optogenetic manipulations of PFL3
               activity support the model. Finally, using a new navigational
               memory task, we show that flies expressing disruptors of synaptic
               transmission in subsets of PFL3 cells have a reduced ability to
               orient along arbitrary goal directions, with an effect size in
               quantitative accordance with the prediction of our model. The
               biological circuit described here reveals how two
               population-level allocentric signals are compared in the brain to
               produce an egocentric output signal that is appropriate for motor
               control.",

               circadian processes, which interact to determine sleep timing and
               duration, but the mechanisms through which the circadian system
               modulates sleep are largely unknown. We therefore used
               adult-specific, temporally controlled neuronal activation and
               inhibition to identify an interaction between the circadian clock
               and a novel population of sleep-promoting neurons in Drosophila.
               METHODS: Transgenic flies expressed either dTRPA1, a neuronal
               activator, or Shibire(ts1), an inhibitor of synaptic release, in
               small subsets of neurons. Sleep, as determined by activity
               monitoring and video tracking, was assessed before and after
               temperature-induced activation or inhibition using these effector
               molecules. We compared the effect of these manipulations in
               control flies and in mutant flies that lacked components of the
               molecular circadian clock. RESULTS: Adult-specific activation or
               inhibition of a population of neurons that projects to the
               sleep-promoting dorsal Fan-Shaped Body resulted in bidirectional
               control over sleep. Interestingly, the magnitude of the sleep
               changes were time-of-day dependent. Activation of sleep-promoting
               neurons was maximally effective during the middle of the day and
               night, and was relatively ineffective during the day-to-night and
               night-to-day transitions. These time-ofday specific effects were
               absent in flies that lacked functional circadian clocks.
               CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the circadian system functions to
               gate sleep through active inhibition at specific times of day.
               These data identify a mechanism through which the circadian
               system prevents premature sleep onset in the late evening, when
               homeostatic sleep drive is high.",

               The fruit fly Drosophila represents a highly tractable model to
               investigate mechanisms of taste processing, but taste circuits
               beyond sensory neurons are largely unidentified. Here, we use a
               whole-brain connectome to investigate the organization of
               Drosophila taste circuits. We trace pathways from four
               populations of sensory neurons that detect different taste
               modalities and project to the subesophageal zone (SEZ), the
               primary taste region of the fly brain. We find that second-order
               taste neurons are primarily located within the SEZ and largely
               segregated by taste modality, whereas third-order neurons have
               more projections outside the SEZ and more overlap between

              Males without OA display low levels of aggression and high levels

               was largely attributed to dietary cysteine intake.
               Mechanistically, dietary cysteine increased the production of a
               neuropeptide FMRFamide (FMRFa). Enhanced FMRFa activity
               simultaneously promoted energy expenditure and suppressed food

              unknown. A complicating factor in trying to elucidate the function
              of sleep is the complexity and multiplicity of neuronal circuits

              distinct sleep-regulating circuits are only involved in specific
              aspects of sleep and may underlie different sleep functions. Thus,
              it would be beneficial to assess the contribution of individual
              circuits in sleep putative functions. The intricacy of the
              mammalian brain makes this task extremely difficult. However, the
              fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, with its simpler brain
              organization, available connectomics, and unparalleled genetics
              offers the opportunity to interrogate individual sleep-regulating
              centers. In Drosophila, neurons projecting to the dorsal
              Fan-Shaped Body (dFB) have been proposed to be key regulators of
              sleep, particularly sleep homeostasis. We recently demonstrated
              that the most widely used genetic tool to manipulate dFB neurons,
              the 23E10-GAL4 driver, expresses in two sleep-regulating neurons
              (VNC-SP neurons) located in the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC), the fly
              analog of the vertebrate spinal cord. Since most data supporting a
              role for the dFB in sleep regulation have been obtained using
              23E10-GAL4, it is unclear whether the sleep phenotypes reported in
              these studies are caused by dFB neurons or VNC-SP cells. A recent
              publication replicated our finding that 23E10-GAL4 contains
              sleep-promoting neurons in the VNC. However, it also proposed that
              the dFB is not involved in sleep regulation at all, but this
              suggestion was made using genetic tools that are not dFB-specific
              and a very mild sleep deprivation protocol. In this study, using a
              newly created dFB-specific genetic driver line, we demonstrate

              divided in 3 populations. Most dFB neurons express both glutamate
              and acetylcholine, while a minority of cells express only one of
              these two neurotransmitters. Importantly, dFB neurons do not
              express GABA, as previously suggested. Using

               the daily life of an animal. Many of these hormones are peptides
               that act at a higher hierarchical level in the animal with roles
               as organizers that globally orchestrate metabolism, physiology
               and behavior. Peptide hormones can act on multiple peripheral
               targets and simultaneously convey basal states, such as metabolic
               status and sleep-awake or arousal across many central neuronal
               circuits. Thereby, they coordinate responses to changing internal
               and external environments. The activity of neurosecretory cells
               is controlled either by (1) cell autonomous sensors, or (2) by
               other neurons that relay signals from sensors in peripheral
               tissues and (3) by feedback from target cells. Thus, a hormonal
               signaling axis commonly comprises several components. In mammals
               and other vertebrates, several hormonal axes are known, such as
               the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis or the
               hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis that regulate reproduction
               and metabolism, respectively. It has been proposed that the basic

               cellular homologs of the hypothalamic-pituitary system can be
               found for instance in insects. To obtain an appreciation of the

              ingestion in flies. We discovered that brain neurons regulating
              food ingestion, IN18, receive excitatory input from enteric
              sensory neurons, which innervate the oesophagus and express the
              sugar receptor Gr43a. These enteric sensory neurons monitor the
              sugar content of food within the oesophagus during ingestion and
              send positive feedback signals to IN1s, stimulating the
              consumption of high-sugar foods. Connectome analyses reveal that
              IN1s form a core ingestion circuit. This interoceptive circuit
              receives synaptic input from enteric afferents and provides
              synaptic output to enteric motor neurons, which modulate the
              activity of muscles at the entry segments of the crop, a

               projecting, serotonin-immunoreactive deutocerebral (CSD) neuron.
               These neurons are thought to function as centrifugal modulators
               of olfactory sensitivity. To examine the phylogenetic
               distribution of 5HT-ir neurons apparently homologous to the CSD

              antennae not only supply sensory information but may also be
              actively positioned by control muscles. However, how flying
              insects move their antennae during active turns and how such
              movements might influence steering responses are currently
              unknown. Here we examined the antennal movements of flying
              Drosophila during visually induced turns in a tethered flight
              arena. In response to both rotational and translational patterns
              of visual motion, Drosophila actively moved their antennae in a
              direction opposite to that of the visual motion. We also observed
              two types of passive antennal movements: small tonic deflections
              of the antenna and rapid oscillations at wing beat frequency.
              These passive movements are likely the result of wing-induced
              airflow and increased in magnitude when the angular distance
              between the wing and the antenna decreased. In response to
              rotational visual motion, increases in passive antennal movements
              appear to trigger a reflex that reduces the stroke amplitude of
              the contralateral wing, thereby enhancing the visually induced
              turn. Although the active antennal movements significantly
              increased antennal oscillation by bringing the arista closer to
              the wings, it did not significantly affect the turning response in
              our head-fixed, tethered flies. These results are consistent with
              the hypothesis that flying Drosophila use mechanosensory feedback
              to detect changes in the wing induced airflow during visually
              induced turns and that this feedback plays a role in regulating
              the magnitude of steering responses.",

              sent from the brain down to local motor circuits, instructing
              these motor circuits to alter the phase at which specific leg
              muscles are activated. Bidaye et al. (p. 97; see the Perspective
              by Mann) identified such a neuron in Drosophila, which they call
              MDN (moonwalker descending neuron). Blocking synaptic transmission
              from MDN inhibited backward walking, and conversely artificially
              activating MDN caused flies to walk backward. Most land animals

               are corticotropin-releasing factor-like diuretic hormone

               behaviors. Here, we investigated the functional relations between
               the LK and DH44 signaling systems. DH44 and LK peptides are only
               colocalized in a set of abdominal neurosecretory cells (ABLKs).
               Targeted knockdown of each of these peptides in ABLKs leads to
               increased resistance to desiccation, starvation and ionic stress.
               Food ingestion is diminished by knockdown of DH44, but not LK,

              of the body and head (the fly's heading) during navigation 1,2. In
              the absence of visual cues, the compass neuron network estimates
              heading by integrating self-movement signals over time3,4. When a
              visual cue is present, the estimate of the network is more
              accurate1,3. Visual inputs to compass neurons are thought to
              originate from inhibitory neurons called R neurons (also known as
              ring neurons); the receptive fields of R neurons tile visual
              space5. The axon of each R neuron overlaps with the dendrites of
              every compass neuron6, raising the question of how visual cues are
              integrated into the compass. Here, using in vivo whole-cell
              recordings, we show that a visual cue can evoke synaptic
              inhibition in compass neurons and that R neurons mediate this
              inhibition. Each compass neuron is inhibited only by specific
              visual cue positions, indicating that many potential connections
              from R neurons onto compass neurons are actually weak or silent.
              We also show that the pattern of visually evoked inhibition can
              reorganize over minutes as the fly explores an altered
              virtual-reality environment. Using ensemble calcium imaging, we
              demonstrate that this reorganization causes persistent changes in
              the compass coordinate frame. Taken together, our data suggest a
              model in which correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity triggers
              associative long-term synaptic depression of visually evoked
              inhibition in compass neurons. Our findings provide evidence for
              the theoretical proposal that associative plasticity of sensory
              inputs, when combined with attractor dynamics, can reconcile
              self-movement information with changing external cues to generate
              a coherent sense of direction7-12.",

              yielded information about neuropeptides and circuits that promote
              feeding, but a peptidergic neuron subset whose activation inhibits
              feeding in adult flies, without promoting metabolic changes that
              mimic the state of satiety, has not been identified. Using
              genetically based manipulations of neuronal activity, we show that
              activation of neurons (or neuroendocrine cells) expressing the
              neuropeptide allatostatin A (AstA) inhibits or limits several

              represses the cdc25c phosphatase String. The repression of String

                 Drosophila , we find that the axons of position-encoding leg
                 proprioceptors are active across behaviors, whereas the axons
                 of movement-encoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during
                 walking and grooming. Using connectomics, we identify a
                 specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic

               accomplish all that it does. Yet today many people still find it
               surprising that insects and other arthropods show behaviors that
               are much more complex than innate reflexes. They are products of
               versatile brains which, in a sense, think.Fascinating in their
               own right, arthropods provide fundamental insights into how
               brains process and organize sensory information to produce
               learning, strategizing, cooperation, and sociality. Nicholas
               Strausfeld elucidates the evolution of this knowledge, beginning
               with nineteenth-century debates about how similar arthropod
               brains were to vertebrate brains. This exchange, he shows, had a
               profound and far-reaching impact on attitudes toward evolution
               and animal origins. Many renowned scientists, including Sigmund
               Freud, cut their professional teeth studying arthropod nervous
               systems. The greatest neuroanatomist of them all, Santiago Ramón
               y Cajal—founder of the neuron doctrine—was awed by similarities
               between insect and mammalian brains.Writing in a style that will
               appeal to a broad readership, Strausfeld weaves anatomical
               observations with evidence from molecular biology, neuroethology,
               cladistics, and the fossil record to explore the neurobiology of
               the largest phylum on earth—and one that is crucial to the

               Underlying neuronal signals are thought to be important for
               exploratory behavior by signaling unintended course deviations
               and by providing spatial information about the environment [1,
               2]. Particularly in insects, the encoding of self-motion-related
               optic flow is well understood [1-5]. However, a gap remains in
               understanding how the associated neuronal activity controls
               locomotor trajectories. In flies, visual projection neurons
               belonging to two groups encode panoramic horizontal motion:
               horizontal system (HS) cells respond with depolarization to
               front-to-back motion and hyperpolarization to the opposite
               direction [6, 7], and other neurons have the mirror-symmetrical
               response profile [6, 8, 9]. With primarily monocular sensitivity,
               the neurons' responses are ambiguous for different rotational and
               translational self-movement components. Such ambiguities can be
               greatly reduced by combining signals from both eyes [10-12] to

               second neuropil or medulla behind the fly's compound eye. These
               neurons embody some of the most stereotyped circuits in one of
               the most miniaturized of animal brains. The reconstructions allow
               us, for the first time to our knowledge, to study variations
               between circuits in the medulla's neighboring columns. This
               variation in the number of synapses and the types of their
               synaptic partners has previously been little addressed because
               methods that visualize multiple circuits have not resolved
               detailed connections, and existing connectomic studies, which can
               see such connections, have not so far examined multiple
               reconstructions of the same circuit. Here, we address the
               omission by comparing the circuits common to all seven columns to
               assess variation in their connection strengths and the resultant
               rates of several different and distinct types of connection
               error. Error rates reveal that, overall, <1\% of contacts are not
               part of a consensus circuit, and we classify those contacts that
               supplement (E+) or are missing from it (E-). Autapses, in which
               the same cell is both presynaptic and postsynaptic at the same
               synapse, are occasionally seen; two cells in particular, Dm9 and
               Mi1, form ≥ 20-fold more autapses than do other neurons. These
               results delimit the accuracy of developmental events that

               precision, and thereby address the operation of such circuits.
               They also establish a precedent for error rates that will be

  abstract = "In many cases, animals do not passively sample sensory
              information, but rather actively move their sensory organs as they
              explore their world. Active movements of sensory organs allow
              animals to control the sensory stream and thus transform sensory
              acquisition into an active process that involves continuous
              interactions between sensory and motor systems. Despite its
              importance, the neural mechanisms underlying active sensory
              processing is not well understood for many modalities due to
              technical difficulties involved in recording from sensory organs
              and measuring sensor movements while an animal is moving through
              its environment. As an initial step in understanding the role of
              active sensor movements in sensory processing, we investigated how
              the activity of antennal mechanosensory neurons change as tethered
              flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) move their antennae
              in response to visual motion. The antennae of fruit flies are
              multimodal sensory organs that contain mechanoreceptors and
              chemoreceptors that respond to a wide variety of sensory stimuli
              including sound, wind, gravity, odorants, humidity, and
              temperature. We have recently shown that the antennae of fruit fly
              move both actively and passively during tethered flight. Passive
              movements are likely caused by the airflow generated by the
              flapping wings, and flies use this feedback to control their wing
              stroke amplitude. During visually-induced turns, flying fruit
              flies actively rotate their antennae in a direction opposite to
              that of the wide-field visual motion. These active movements are
              absent in the non-flying flies presented with the same visual
              motion, suggesting that they play a role specific to flight.
              However, these previous experiments could not determine whether
              different populations of mechanosensory neurons respond to
              different types of antennal motions during flight, and how active
              antennal movements change the activities of these neurons. To
              address these questions, we expressed a genetically-encoded
              calcium indicator (GCaMP3) in different groups of Johnston?s organ
              (JO) neurons, which are the major mechanosensory neurons of
              antennae, and imaged their activity in tethered flying flies using
              two-photon excitation microscopy. We used a simple virtual reality
              panorama to present wide-field visual motions and a moving
              vertical stripe to the flies to induce motor responses of the
              wings and antennae. While recording the activities of JO neurons,
              we simultaneously tracked the movement of the antenna using
              machine vision system to determine the type of antennal motion to
              which each group of JO neurons respond. We found that some JO
              neurons increase their activity during flight, suggesting that
              these neurons may be responding to the passive antennal motion
              caused by wing-induced airflow. Furthermore, a subgroup of JO
              neurons changed its activity during the active antennal motion
              that accompanies visually-induced turns, suggesting that these
              neurons may be responding to either the active antennal motion
              itself, or the changes in passive antennal motion that results
              from the active changes in antennal position. We are currently
              trying to identify possible downstream targets of these neurons to
              further our understanding of how active antennal motions affect

               and water loss becomes crucial when locomotor activity is
               increased during flight and metabolic needs are greatest. Insects
               that keep their spiracles mostly closed during flight reduce
               water loss but limit the flux of oxygen and carbon dioxide into
               and out of the tracheal system and thus attenuate locomotor
               performance. Insects that keep their spiracles completely open
               allow maximum gas exchange but face desiccation stress more
               quickly. Experiments in which water vapor was used as a tracer
               gas to track changes in the conductance of the respiratory system
               indicated that flying fruit flies minimize potential water loss
               by matching the area of the open spiracles to their gas exchange
               required for metabolic needs. This behavior maintained
               approximately constant pressure for carbon dioxide (1.35

              flies, an influential autocorrelation model for motion detection,
              the elementary motion detector circuit (EMD; [4, 5]), compares
              visual signals from neighboring photoreceptors to derive
              information on motion direction and velocity. This information is
              fed by two types of interneuron, L1 and L2, in the first optic
              neuropile, or lamina, to downstream local motion detectors in
              columns of the second neuropile, the medulla. Despite receiving
              carefully matched photoreceptor inputs, L1 and L2 drive distinct,
              separable pathways responding preferentially to moving ``on'' and
              ``off'' edges, respectively [6, 7]. Our serial electron microscopy
              (EM) identifies two types of transmedulla (Tm) target neurons, Tm1
              and Tm2, that receive apparently matched synaptic inputs from L2.
              Tm2 neurons also receive inputs from two retinotopically posterior
              neighboring columns via L4, a third type of lamina neuron. Light
              microscopy reveals that the connections in these L2/L4/Tm2
              circuits are highly determinate. Single-cell transcript profiling
              suggests that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors mediate
              transmission within the L2/L4/Tm2 circuits, whereas L1 is
              apparently glutamatergic. We propose that Tm2 integrates
              sign-conserving inputs from neighboring columns to mediate the
              detection of front-to-back motion generated during forward motion.",

               With simulations and psychophysics, we demonstrate that walking

               exploiting the geometry of positional changes of objects on

               LPLC1, whose tuning mirrors the behavior and whose activity
               drives slowing. LPLC1 pools inputs from object and motion
               detectors, and spatially biased inhibition tunes it to the

               Sensory detection of food regulates internal nutrient

               sensory pathways that promote anticipatory physiological changes

               neurons into the activation of insulin-producing cells and
               enteric neurons in Drosophila. One class of 5-HT neurons responds
               to gustatory detection of sugars, excites insulin-producing
               cells, and limits consumption, suggesting that they anticipate
               increased nutrient levels and prevent overconsumption. A second
               class of 5-HT neurons responds to gustatory detection of bitter
               compounds and activates enteric neurons to promote gastric
               motility, likely to stimulate digestion and increase circulating
               nutrients upon food rejection. These studies demonstrate that

                  contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular,
                  dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential
                  to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of

                  to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard

               sustained for 32·2 h with only short interruptions during uptake

               the difference of the wingbeat amplitudes on either side have
               been used to simulate the rotatory displacement of the
               surrounding landmarks during a comparable turn in free flight.
               Stabilization of a target in the preferred area of the visual
               field requires continuous visual attention. A rate of about 5
               course-correcting manoeuvres per second was maintained throughout
               the experiment. Drosophila seems to be able to cover long
               distances in search of a favourable habitat. Flight-specific
               carbohydrate consumption is equivalent to a metabolic power input
               per body weight of about 18 W N−1. The tethered fly produces
               about 40 \% of the lift required to sustain hovering flight. The
               resulting mechanochemical efficiency of about 0·04-0·07 is within
               the expected order of magnitude for flying insects. Expenditure
               of reserve substances may account for the difference between the
               comparatively low power input of about 7 W N−1, derived from
               carbohydrate uptake in the first hours of flight (Wigglesworth,
               1949), and the actual metabolic turnover of about 21 WN−1,
               derived from oxygen consumption during this period
               (Laurie-Ahlberg et al. 1985). Weis-Fogh’s ‘clap and fling’, a
               widespread lift-generating process exploiting the aerodynamic
               wing interference at the dorsal end of the wingbeat, was in
               action throughout the flight. However, there were two significant
               modifications (as first conceived by Ellington, 1980) : (1)
               during ‘clap’, there is a progress of wing contact from the
               leading to the trailing edge, which is likely to ‘squeeze’ a
               thrust-generating jet of air to the rear; (2) during ‘fling’,
               there is a progress of wing separation in the same direction,
               which is described as a ‘peel’ resembling the progressive
               separation of two plastic foils pulled apart against forces of
               mutual attraction. The wings of the test fly survived about 23
               million such peels without damage. Increasing airspeed decreases
               the intensity of ‘clap and fling’ in Drosophila : results
               obtained in the wind tunnel show the transition to a ‘near clap
               and fling’, lacking mutual wing contact.",

              circuits and motor neurons (MNs) in the nerve cord of the animal’s
              body that effect movement of the limbs. To understand how brain
              signals generate behavior, it is critical to understand how these
              descending pathways are organized onto the body MNs. In the fly,
              Drosophila melanogaster , MNs controlling muscles in the leg,
              wing, and other motor systems reside in a ventral nerve cord
              (VNC), analogous to the mammalian spinal cord. In companion
              papers, we introduced a densely-reconstructed connectome of the
              Drosophila Male Adult Nerve Cord (MANC, Takemura et al., 2023),
              including cell type and developmental lineage annotation (Marin et
              al., 2023), which provides complete VNC connectivity at synaptic

              the VNC networks connecting DNs to MNs based on this new
              connectome information. We proofread and curated all DNs and MNs

              axon terminals and MN dendrites with light microscopy data to link
              their VNC morphology with their brain inputs or muscle targets. We
              report both broad organizational patterns of the entire network

              discover that direct DN-MN connections are infrequent and identify

              effectively decoupling visual stimuli from the landing motor

                 turn, update internal representations that support navigational
                 computations are not well understood. Recent work in Drosophila
                 has identified a neural circuit that performs angular path
                 integration to compute the fly’s head direction, but the nature
                 of the velocity signal is unknown. Here we identify a pair of
                 neurons necessary for angular path integration that encode the
                 fly’s rotational velocity with high accuracy using both visual
                 optic flow and motor information. This estimate of rotational
                 velocity does not rely on a moment-to-moment integration of
                 sensory and motor information. Rather, when visual and motor
                 signals are congruent, these neurons prioritize motor
                 information over visual information, and when the two signals
                 are in conflict, reciprocal inhibition selects either the motor
                 or visual signal. Together, our results suggest that flies
                 update their head direction representation by constructing an
                 estimate of rotational velocity that relies primarily on motor
                 information and only incorporates optic flow signals in
                 specific sensorimotor contexts, such as when the motor signal

               specifies the synaptic paths by which neurons can affect each
               other, but not how strongly they do affect each other in vivo. To
               overcome this limitation, we introduce a combined experimental
               and statistical strategy for efficiently learning a causal model
               of the fly brain, which we refer to as the 'effectome'.
               Specifically, we propose an estimator for a linear dynamical
               model of the fly brain that uses stochastic optogenetic
               perturbation data to estimate causal effects and the connectome
               as a prior to greatly improve estimation efficiency. We validate
               our estimator in connectome-based linear simulations and show
               that it recovers a linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamics
               of more biophysically realistic simulations. We then analyse the
               connectome to propose circuits that dominate the dynamics of the
               fly nervous system. We discover that the dominant circuits
               involve only relatively small populations of neurons-thus,
               neuron-level imaging, stimulation and identification are
               feasible. This approach also re-discovers known circuits and
               generates testable hypotheses about their dynamics. Overall, we
               provide evidence that fly whole-brain dynamics are generated by a
               large collection of small circuits that operate largely
               independently of each other. This implies that a causal model of
               a brain can be feasibly obtained in the fly.",

              Application of the Flp-out technique enabled visualization of 27

              morphology and distribution of genetic markers, we found that most

              interest, from one of the fields of research in which Dixon
              himself was active. Special mention is made of his work with
              Brodie on the physiology and pharmacology of the bronchioles and
              the pulmonary blood-vessels, as probably showing the beginning of
              Dixon's interest in the actions of the alkaloids and organic bases
              which reproduce the effects of autonomic nerves.An account is
              given of Dixon's early interest in the suggestion, first made by
              Elliott, that autonomic nerves transmit their effects by
              releasing, at their endings, specific substances, which reproduce
              their actions; and of his attempt to obtain experimental support
              for this conception. After the War it was established by the
              experiments of O. Loewi; and it is now generally recognized that
              parasympathetic effects are so transmitted by release of
              acetylcholine, sympathetic effects by that of a substance related
              to adrenaline.Very recent evidence indicates that acetylcholine,
              by virtue of its other (``nicotine-like'') action, also acts as
              transmitter of activity at synapses in autonomic ganglia, and from
              motor nerve to voluntary muscle.The terms ``cholinergic'' and
              ``adrenergic'' have been introduced to describe nerve-fibres which
              transmit their actions by the release at their endings of
              acetylcholine, and of a substance related to adrenaline,
              respectively. It is shown that Langley and Anderson's evidence,
              long available, as to the kinds of peripheral efferent fibres
              which can replace one another in regeneration, can be summarized
              by the statement, that cholinergic can replace cholinergic fibres,
              and that adrenergic can replace adrenergic fibres; but that fibres
              of different chemical function cannot replace one another. The
              bearing of this new evidence on conceptions of the mode of action
              of ``neuromimetic'' drugs is discussed. The pharmacological
              problem can now be more clearly defined, and Dixon's participation
              in further attempts at its solution will be sadly missed.",

              fly, Drosophila melanogaster, including α-synuclein-induced
              degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, or dopamine (DA) loss by
              genetic elimination of neural DA synthesis. Defective behaviors in

              L-DOPA, analogous to the treatment paradigm for PD. Secondary
              complication from L-DOPA treatment in PD patients are associated
              with ectopic synthesis of DA in serotonin (5-HT)-releasing

               identified a subtype of uncharacterized circadian DN3 neurons

               The CLs feedback onto a subset of DN1s to form a positive

               combinations to produce those movements is not well understood.
               For anterior grooming behavior in the fly, we show that its
               component head sweeps and leg rubs can be initiated separately,
               or as a set, by different descending neurons. Head sweeps and leg
               rubs are mutually exclusive movements of the front legs that
               normally alternate, and we show that circuits in the ventral
               nerve cord as well as in the brain can resolve competing
               commands. Finally, the left and right legs must work together to
               remove debris. The coordination for leg rubs can be achieved by
               unilateral activation of a single descending neuron, while a

              neurons with activity peaks in different task epochs. We developed
              neural-circuit models of the computations performed by these

              populations with opposite selectivity amplifies selective inputs,
              thereby improving the encoding of trial-type information. The

              choice-specific sequential activity. These results provide

              activation depends on VAChT expression in Kenyon cells and is

              sub-millisecond modifications in wing-steering muscle activity are
              necessary for stability and maneuverability. Although the muscles

              Drosophila melanogaster is subserved by the mushroom body (MB).
              Upon arrival in the MB, sensory information undergoes a profound
              transformation. Olfactory projection neurons (PNs), the main MB
              input, exhibit broadly tuned, sustained, and stereotyped responses
              to odorants; in contrast, their postsynaptic targets in the MB,
              the Kenyon cells (KCs), are nonstereotyped, narrowly tuned, and
              only briefly responsive to odorants. Theory and experiment have
              suggested that this transformation is implemented by random
              connectivity between KCs and PNs. However, this hypothesis has
              been challenging to test, given the difficulty of mapping synaptic
              connections between large numbers of neurons to achieve a unified
              view of neuronal network structure. Here we used a recent
              whole-brain electron microscopy (EM) volume of the adult fruit fly
              to map large numbers of PN- to-KC connections at synaptic
              resolution. Comparison of the observed connectome to precisely
              defined null models revealed unexpected network structure, in
              which a subset of food-responsive PN types converge on individual
              downstream KCs more frequently than expected. The connectivity
              bias is consistent with the neurogeometry: axons of the
              overconvergent PNs tend to arborize near one another in the MB
              main calyx, making local KC dendrites more likely to receive input
              from those types. Computational modeling of the observed PN-to-KC
              network showed that input from the overconvergent PN types is
              better discriminated than input from other types. These results
              suggest an ‘associative fovea’ for olfaction, in that the MB is
              wired to better discriminate more frequently occurring and
              ethologically relevant combinations of food-related odors. \#\#\#

               via feedback from mechanoreceptors at the base of the wings and
               structures unique to flies called halteres [7-9]. Evolved from
               the hindwings, the tiny halteres oscillate at the same frequency
               as the wings, although they serve no aerodynamic function [10]
               and are thought to act as gyroscopes [10-15]. Like the wings,
               halteres possess minute control muscles whose activity is
               modified by descending visual input [16], raising the possibility

              functions like a switchboard in which neuromodulation reroutes the

              the state and experience of the fly. Using functional synaptic

              spatial specificity, allowing individual neurons to differentially
              convey olfactory signals to each of their postsynaptic targets.

               modulate diverse physiological and behavioral processes. However,
               a single-cell resolution understanding of the connectivity of
               serotonergic neurons is currently lacking. Using a whole-brain EM
               dataset of a female Drosophila, we comprehensively determine the
               wiring logic of a broadly projecting serotonergic neuron (the
               CSDn) that spans several olfactory regions. Within the antennal
               lobe, the CSDn differentially innervates each glomerulus, yet
               surprisingly, this variability reflects a diverse set of
               presynaptic partners, rather than glomerulus-specific differences
               in synaptic output, which is predominately to local interneurons.
               Moreover, the CSDn has distinct connectivity relationships with
               specific local interneuron subtypes, suggesting that the CSDn
               influences distinct aspects of local network processing. Across
               olfactory regions, the CSDn has different patterns of
               connectivity, even having different connectivity with individual
               projection neurons that also span these regions. Whereas the CSDn
               targets inhibitory local neurons in the antennal lobe, the CSDn
               has more distributed connectivity in the LH, preferentially
               synapsing with principal neuron types based on transmitter
               content. Last, we identify individual novel synaptic partners
               associated with other sensory domains that provide strong,
               top-down input to the CSDn. Together, our study reveals the
               complex connectivity of serotonergic neurons, which combine the

               receive serotonergic modulatory input. However, a comprehensive
               understanding of the synaptic connectivity of individual
               serotonergic neurons is lacking. In this study, we use a
               whole-brain EM microscopy dataset to comprehensively determine
               the wiring logic of a broadly projecting serotonergic neuron in
               the olfactory system of Drosophila Collectively, our study
               demonstrates, at a single-cell level, the complex connectivity of

               specific cell classes heavily targeted for serotonergic

               neurons that provide strong input to this serotonergic system

               served by the amine in aggression have been difficult to define
               because dopaminergic systems influence many behaviors, and all
               can be altered by changing the function of dopaminergic neurons.
               In the fruit fly, with the powerful genetic tools available,
               small subsets of brain cells can be reliably manipulated,
               offering enormous advantages for exploration of how and where
               amine neurons fit into the circuits involved with aggression. By
               combining the GAL4/upstream activating sequence (UAS) binary
               system with the Flippase (FLP) recombination technique, we were
               able to restrict the numbers of targeted DA neurons down to a
               single-cell level. To explore the function of these individual
               dopaminergic neurons, we inactivated them with the tetanus toxin
               light chain, a genetically encoded inhibitor of neurotransmitter
               release, or activated them with dTrpA1, a temperature-sensitive

               PPM3 cluster. Both activation and inactivation of these neurons
               resulted in an increase in aggression. We demonstrate that the

               neurons project to different parts of the central complex,

               navigation, and studies on flies have provided profound insights
               into the cellular and circuit bases of this neural computation.
               The fly's directionally selective T4 and T5 neurons encode ON and
               OFF motion, respectively. Their axons terminate in one of the
               four retinotopic layers in the lobula plate, where each layer
               encodes one of the four directions of motion. Although the input
               circuitry of the directionally selective neurons has been studied
               in detail, the synaptic connectivity of circuits integrating
               T4/T5 motion signals is largely unknown. Here, we report a 3D
               electron microscopy reconstruction, wherein we comprehensively
               identified T4/T5's synaptic partners in the lobula plate,
               revealing a diverse set of new cell types and attributing new
               connectivity patterns to the known cell types. Our reconstruction

               cells that project to the same layer connect to common synaptic

              connectomes-of brain regions and even entire brains. The emergence
              of these increasingly large-scale connectomic datasets have
              intensified the need for efficient and accurate neuronal cell type
              identification. Traditional approaches rely on labor-intensive
              analyses of molecular, anatomical, and physiological features. As
              a step toward fully automated neuronal cell type classification,
              we present NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity) - a
              method for grouping neurons into cell types based solely on
              synaptic connectivity. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis
              that synaptic connectivity is key to determining neuronal cell
              types (Seung 2012), and our results provide the strongest evidence
              to date supporting its validity. NTAC comes in two flavors: a
              semi-supervised variant that requires some of the neurons to be
              labeled, and an unsupervised variant that requires no labels at
              all. The first can be naturally formalized as a learning problem
              on graphs: given labels for a subset of neurons, use connectivity
              to label the rest. We present a simple and fast algorithm that
              achieves over 95\% accuracy on the fly's visual system starting
              with just 2\% of neurons labeled, within minutes on a standard PC.
              In contrast, morphology based parallel achieves lower accuracy
              even on smaller datasets and with significantly more labels.
              Formalizing the problem as a fully unsupervised learning task is
              more challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel
              computational problem, approximate equitable partitioning , and
              design an efficient heuristic for it, using the semi-supervised
              algorithm as a subroutine. Remarkably, the unsupervised method
              achieves ∼70\% accuracy on the fly's visual system, drastically
              outperforming its morphology based parallel and providing concrete
              evidence that synaptic connectivity alone can reveal cell types.
              Both variants of NTAC are evaluated on multiple state of the art
              connectomes including optic lobes, central brain and nerve cord of
              adult fruit flies.",
